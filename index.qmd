## Goals
My short term goal (and Master's project) is to investigate migrating river herring movements in the Bellamy River in Dover, NH and determine if fish are moving upstream past the site of a former dam that has recently been removed. Long term, I hope to eventually become a fish biologist at a state or federal natural resource agency.

## Education
I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2023 with a Bachelor's Degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with minors in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Wildlife Management.I am currently a first year Master's student in the Marine Biology Program at the University of New Hampshire, and am also a member of Dr. Nathan Furey's Fish and Movement Ecology Lab.

## Experience
At UConn, I was an undergraduate research assistant on a project investigating juvenile alewife migrations, a small anadromous fish native to the Atlantic Coast. Most recently, I worked as a fisheries technician with the Connecticut Inland Fisheries Division, where I took part in statewide fish surveys, population estimates, and removal/restoration efforts.
