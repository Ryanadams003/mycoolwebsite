Long term, I hope to eventually become a fish biologist at a state or federal natural resource agency.\n\n\n\nI graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2023 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with minors in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Wildlife Management.\n\n\n\nAt UConn, I was an undergraduate research assistant on a project investigating juvenile alewife migrations, a small anadromous fish native to the Atlantic Coast. Most recently, I worked as a fisheries technician with the Connecticut Inland Fisheries Division, where I took part in statewide fish surveys, population estimates, and removal/restoration efforts.\nThanks for checking out my web site! Above is a picture of myself and a massive northern pike caught in Mansfield Hollow, Connecticut."
