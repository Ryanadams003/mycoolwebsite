Most recently, I worked as a fisheries technician with the Connecticut Inland Fisheries Division, where I took part in statewide fish surveys, population estimates, and removal/restoration efforts.\nThanks for checking out my web site! Above is a picture of myself and a massive northern pike caught on Mansfield Hollow, Connecticut."
